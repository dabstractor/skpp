# Bash completion for skilldozer.

# Tags are derived DYNAMICALLY from disk by calling `skilldozer --relative --all`
# (skilldozer is manifest-free, PRD §2.1: there is no sidecar catalog to read).
#
# LOCKSTEP: the flag set below is frozen to `main.go parseArgs()`. If a future
# task adds/renames a flag there, update this list — and the zsh/fish files —
# identically. There is no shared source of truth the shells can import.
# Flags are long-form-only (decision 20): short aliases stay valid at runtime
# but are not advertised. Updated for --check/--init/--completions (decision 19):
# these were promoted from bare subcommands so the bare positional namespace
# belongs to skill tags — a bare <tab> shows skills, never commands.
# --shell's value completes to the bash/zsh/fish enum (§14.2); --shell is
# advertised (D7) since it is a real, documented flag in usageText OPTIONS.

# --- §14.7 listing behavior (decision 22) -------------------------------------
# skilldozer wants every ambiguous match listed on the FIRST Tab — a manifest-free
# store (PRD §2) makes completion the primary discovery path, so candidates hidden
# behind a silent common-prefix halt are a UX defect. bash defaults to
# show-all-if-ambiguous OFF: the first Tab completes the common prefix and beeps,
# and the full list appears only on the second Tab.
#
# The line below sets show-all-if-ambiguous ON so all prefix matches list on the
# first Tab. This is a READLINE SESSION-GLOBAL option: it changes listing for EVERY
# command in this shell, not just skilldozer (there is no per-command scope). The
# `[[ $- == *i* ]] &&` guard keeps this quiet when the file is sourced
# non-interactively (e.g. an eval test harness): `bind` in a non-interactive shell
# prints a warning, which the guard silences. Completions only matter interactively,
# so the option still applies where it counts. The trailing `|| true` ensures
# `source`/`eval` of this file returns exit 0 even in a non-interactive shell, where
# the `[[ ... ]]` test is false and the `&&` would otherwise short-circuit the whole
# statement (and thus the source/eval) to exit 1 — which would abort a `.bashrc`
# running under `set -e` or break `source ... && cmd` one-liners.
{ [[ $- == *i* ]] && bind 'set show-all-if-ambiguous on'; } || true
# Opt-out — restore bash's stock (second-Tab) listing:
#   bind 'set show-all-if-ambiguous off'
