# Example Skill

This skill exists only so `skpp` has something to resolve.

Try:

```bash
skpp example                       # prints this directory's absolute path
skpp -f example                    # prints .../skills/example/SKILL.md
pi --skill "$(skpp example)"       # loads this skill into pi
```
